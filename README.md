# Weather App

The assignment was to build a simple weather dashboard using a weather API. It should tell today’s weather, temperature and also a 5-day forecast. It was also an exercise in working as a dev team with GitHub branches etc.

## The problem

Once we learned how to fetch the API data it was a lot trickier to get some of the data rendered to the DOM than others. Getting the weekday names right (and working on most browsers) was probably the most challenging. We also had some issues with the merging…

To build the app we used a lot of concepts introduced in previous weeks like conditional statements and forEach() etc. But also new things like the Date object. Our planning could have been better, we kind of jumped right ahead and started to try to get things to work instead of planning the work properly beforehand  We didn’t have a lot of time where we could work together either, and the project was maybe a little too small to divide the tasks evenly between us. 

If we had more time we would try to get the user’s coordinates when the app loads instead of just setting a city that shows up when you load the app no matter where you are. We would also have added messages/icons/color schemes for other weather conditions like snow, thunder etc.
