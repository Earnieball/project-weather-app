# Weather App

The assignment was to build a simple weather dashboard using a weather API.

## The problem

Once we learned how to fetch the API data it was a lot trickier to get some of the data rendered to the DOM than others. Getting the weekday names right (and working on most browsers) was probably the most challenging.

To build the app we used a lot of concepts introduced in previous weeks like conditional statements and array methods such as forEach etc, but also new things like the Date object.

If we had more time we would try to get the userâ€™s coordinates when the app loads instead of just setting a city that shows up when you load the app no matter where you are. We would also have added messages/icons/color schemes for other weather conditions like snow, thunder etc.
